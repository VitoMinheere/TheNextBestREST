## The Next Best REST
My idea for the perfect REST API endpoint in Python. Used as a placeholder which I can copy when having to build yet another basic REST endpoint.

Will build one in Django, Flask and FastAPI. Using the same SQLite db for simple iteration.

## The API
The API will be used to create reviews for places. The models used are:
- Users
- Places
- Reviews

All of the models will have a CRUD interface.
